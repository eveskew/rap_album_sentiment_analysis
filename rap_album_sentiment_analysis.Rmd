# It Begins...

This whole thing started after I read an 
<a href="http://juliasilge.com/blog/If-I-Loved-NLP-Less/" target="_blank">excellent blog post by Julia Silge</a>. You should definitely check it out, but the short version is that she used language processing tools within R to analyze the sentiment in Jane Austen's novels. This led to the natural question: could I do this with rap albums? I didn't learn R coding just to write a dissertation, right?!

In the same way that Julia looked at Austen's entire body of work, I thought it would be interesting to look at one musical artist's whole commercial output. Within hip hop, Kanye seems like a natural choice. He's got seven albums out, which I'd argue encompass a greater musical diversity than probably any other recent, popular musician. Some of his later albums, particulalry *808s & Heartbreak* and *Yeezus* have been polarizing, even for fans of his early work. So his catalog seems ripe for a sentiment analysis. Would the sentiment analysis indicate major differences in feeling across his career arc? Is there really an 
<a href="http://www.hillydilly.com/2016/02/kanye-west-i-love-kanye-stefan-ponce-version/" target="_blank">"old Kanye" to miss</a>, lyrically speaking?

Anyways, what follows is my best shot at this analysis. Major credit to Julia Silge here. My work followed pretty easily from the code she had already written. And since we're dealing with hip hop here, let's not say I stole her code. I sampled it. I remixed it. If you don't care anything about how I actually did the analysis in R, you can skip **The Geeky Stuff** section and head right along to **The Rap Stuff**.

# The Geeky Stuff

In thinking about the general problem, it seemed to me there were three major steps to the analysis:

1.  Get the lyrics for the albums that I want to analyze. Julia already had this solved for her work because she had the text of Austen's novels packaged up nice and neat. I was starting from scratch.

2.  Perform the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentiment_analysis" target="_blank">sentiment analysis</a>. Julia already solved this problem for me.

3.  Visualize the results. Julia mostly solved this problem for me.

Here's how I went about addressing these tasks:

1.  In thinking about how to get lyrics I wanted, the answer seemed pretty obvious to me: the website 
<a href="http://genius.com/" target="_blank">*Genius*</a> (formerly *Rap Genius*). If you haven't checked out *Genius*, you should. It's essentially a wiki-type site dedicated to song lyrics. Contributors both transcribe the lyrics and annotate them for meaning. For my purposes, I just needed to get the lyrics out of the webpages and into R, preferably for whole albums at once. To do this, I used the handy R package 
<a href="https://github.com/hadley/rvest" target="_blank">`rvest`</a>. It was my first time using it, but it allowed me to scrape lyrics off the web quickly and easily. I wrote a few R functions that allowed me to simply input the *Genius* page of the album I was interested in and pretty quickly process the entire album's worth of lyrics.

2.  For the sentiment analysis, I just followed Julia's lead. Major disclaimer: I know very little about sentiment analysis. My basic understanding is that it's used to quantify the subject feelings that are present in a written text. Julia has a nice comparison of metrics that might be used to compute sentiment scores, and she settled on the `bing` method from the package `syuzhet` since it did not seem to be biased or overly variable. Good enough for her, good enough for me.

3.  Again, I followed Julia's example here. I thought her visuals using `ggplot2` looked really nice, so I just modified her code slightly. Whereas Julia was analyzing an entire novel's worth of text at once, my texts had clear dividing points since an album is made up of discrete tracks. Thus, I added some visual elements to the plots to help distinguish between tracks within an album.

All these tasks can be done with surprisingly few R packages. Here's what I used:

```{r, message = F, warning = F}

library(dplyr)
library(rvest)
library(stringr)
library(syuzhet)
library(ggplot2)
library(png)
```

To summarize, I'm using `dplyr` for general data manipulation, `rvest` for web scraping, `stringr` for manipulation of lyrics once I get them into R, `syuzhet` to conduct the sentiment analysis, and `ggplot2` and `png` to create the plots.

# The Rap Stuff

Ok, let's get on with it already. But first, one revelation: I lied about this being just about Kanye. I wanted to "ground truth" the method with some other popular hip hop albums (and just because I thought it'd be fun). The first album that came to mind was Kendrick Lamar's *To Pimp A Butterfly*, so that's what I did first. For just this first plot, I'll show you the code. Here's the entire analysis for this album:

&nbsp; <!-- inserting extra blank line --> 

```{r tpab_analysis, fig.width = 15, fig.height = 7, fig.align = "center", warning = F}

# To Pimp A Butterfly Analysis


tpab.htmls <- get_track_htmls(
  "http://genius.com/albums/Kendrick-lamar/To-pimp-a-butterfly", 
  "Kendrick")
tpab.htmls <- tpab.htmls[2:17]


tpab.album <- process_album(tpab.htmls)
tpab.chunked <- chunk_text(tpab.album)
tpab.tracksplits <- get_track_splits(tpab.chunked, tpab.htmls)


tpab.sentiment <- process_sentiment(tpab.album, "bing")


tpab.anno <- data.frame(x = find_middle(tpab.tracksplits, tpab.chunked), 
                        y = rep(c(11, 9), 20)[1:length(tpab.tracksplits)], 
                        label = c("Wesley's Theory", "For Free?",
                                  "King Kunta", "Institutionalized",
                                  "These Walls", "u", "Alright",
                                  "For Sale?", "Momma",
                                  "Hood Politics", "How Much...",
                                  "Complexion...",
                                  "The Blacker The Berry",
                                  "You Ain't Gotta Lie...",
                                  "i", "Mortal Man"))
tpab.image <- readPNG("images/tpab.png")
p.tpab <- 
  plot_sentiment(tpab.sentiment, tpab.anno, tpab.tracksplits, tpab.image)
p.tpab + 
  labs(title = 
         expression(paste("Sentiment in ", italic("To Pimp A Butterfly"))))
```

So you see that the resulting plot is very similar to what Julia produced in her analyses, except I've used vertical dotted lines to delineate tracks within an album. I also plotted positive sentiments in green and negative sentiments in red just to make the difference more obvious. I think this is also a good time to mention that I really have no idea how well this `bing` sentiment method may or may not be doing in analyzing a hip hop album. The *Genius* community certainly does a very thorough job of annotating albums, but I would imagine that much of the content of these albums is quite unusual for such an analysis. To give you an idea, here's one of the chunks of *To Pimp A Butterfly*:

```{r, echo = F}

tpab.chunked$text[69]
```

If you've heard any of the albums I'll be analyzing, you know it gets a lot more colorful than that. So I'd say that while these methods are capable of giving us answers, I'd take it all with a grain of salt. 

I don't think there are ton of surprises here.

Since I did a Kendrick album, I felt obligated to give Drake some attention too. 
<a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/barack-obama-declares-kendrick-lamar-better-than-drake-20160115" target="_blank">The President may have given Kendrick the nod</a>, but what do the numbers look like? People could argue about this (and people I know will probably argue with me about this), but I think *Take Care* is probably his best album to this point, so let's plot that one:
