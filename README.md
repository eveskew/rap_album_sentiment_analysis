### Rap Album Sentiment Analysis in R

This project was inspired by a blog post written by Julia Silge analyzing the sentiment in Jane Austen's novels (see here: http://juliasilge.com/blog/If-I-Loved-NLP-Less/). I've written code to scrape the website *Genius* for lyrics and modified Julia's code to perform a sentiment analysis on these lyrics. I've used this workflow to perform a sentiment analysis on multiple hip hop albums, particularly Kanye's.
